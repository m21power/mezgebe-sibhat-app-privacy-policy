# Privacy Policy

**መዝገበ ስብሐት** (“the App”) is an educational application designed to provide access to the sacred teachings of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how the App handles user information.

## 1. Information Collection and Use
The App **does not collect, store, or share any personal data**. This includes, but is not limited to, names, email addresses, phone numbers, device identifiers, or location data.

## 2. Access to Media Files
The App **does not access your photos or videos without your consent**. If you choose to select a photo or video within the App (for example, to use as content for a feature), the App uses the **system picker**, and the file is accessed **only temporarily for that specific action**.  

- The App does **not request broad access** to your media library.  
- No selected files are uploaded or shared with third parties.

## 3. App Content and Local Storage
All audio and text content provided in the App is for educational purposes only.

- Audio files may be **cached locally on the user’s device** after first playback to allow offline access.  
- Any images or screenshots used within the App are stored **locally on the device only**.  
- No content is uploaded to external servers or shared with third parties.

## 4. Third-Party Services
The App **does not use advertisements, analytics tools, or third-party SDKs** that collect or process user data.

## 5. Data Security
Since the App does not collect or transmit personal information, no personal data is stored or processed by the developer.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
Any updates to this Privacy Policy will be posted in this repository, along with a revised effective date.

## 7. Contact Information
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you may contact the developer at:
